# Ragtacts

RAG(Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with your own evolving data.

## What is RAG?

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a language model architecture that combines 
a large pre-trained language model with a retrieval system to access external knowledge sources 
like Wikipedia. This allows the model to generate outputs based not only on its training data, 
but also on relevant information retrieved from these knowledge bases, enabling improved factual 
grounding and question-answering capabilities.
